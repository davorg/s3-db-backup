# s3-db-backup
Program to backup a MySQL database to an S3 bucket

A simple program that I use to backup several MySQL databases to various S3 buckets.

Originally written by Aaron Crane (@arc), and lightly genericised by me.

This uses [s3cmd](http://s3tools.org/s3cmd) to to the actual interaction with S3.
